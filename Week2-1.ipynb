    "#### The difference between`elif` and `if`?\n",
    "\n",
    "When an `elif` condition is met, all other `elif` statements are skipped over. This means that one (and only one) [flow control statement](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) is executed when using `elif` statements. The fact that only one `elif` statement is executed is important because it may be possible for multiple [flow control statements](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) to evaluate to  ```True```. A series of `elif` statements evaluates from top-to-bottom, only executing the first `elif` statement whose condition evaluates to  ```True```. The rest of the `elif` statements are skipped over (whether they are  ```True``` or  ```False```).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a set of mutually exclusive `if` statements will result in the same actions as an `if` statement followed by `elif` statements. There are a few good reasons, however, to use `elif` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A series of `elif` statements helps someone reading your code understand that a single flow control choice is being made.\n",
    "2. Using `elif` statements will make your program run faster since other conditional statements are skipped after the first evaluates to  ```True```. Otherwise, every `if` statement has to be evaluated before the program moves to the next step.\n",
    "3. Writing a mutually exclusive set of `if` statements can be very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous code cell, try changing the `elif` to an `if`. Then answer the question with a \"Yes.\" You'll receive two responses! Why do you think that is?"
